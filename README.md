# Feedback-System
## Abstract
In Feedback form the faculty members will create feedback form as per the requirements and it
will be assigned to users as per the Unique ID’s assigned by faculty. The student will provide
feedback using their Unique ID’s and their feedback will be anonymously recorded and their identity won’t be revealed to faculty. The faculty members can analyse the feedback given to them and they can figure out which student hasn’t given the feedback so that it would be easier for faculty members to get feedback from most of the students. The Head of Department can view which faculty has made the feedback form and can see the student who hadn’t replied to that form.
